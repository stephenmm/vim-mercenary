mercenary.vim
============

I'm not going to lie to you; mercenary.vim may very well be the worst
Mercurial wrapper of all time.  

This is my fork of Jamie Wong's great work. I needed to modify it
slightly to work with subrepos. So far I have only got the HGblame
working with subrepos.

Show and Tell
-------------

Here are some screenshots showing off some the mercenary's dirty work:

`:HGblame` will annotate the current file with the blame.

`:HGdiff {rev}` will diff the current file against the specified revision.

`:HGshow {rev}` will show the commit message and diff for the specified 
revision.

`:HGcat {rev} {path}` will show the specified file at the specified revision.

Installation
------------

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend
installing [NeoBundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim) and adding

    NeoBundle 'stephenmm/vim-mercenary'

to your `.vimrc` then next time you start vim it will instal itself.

If you prefer [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), after 
installing it, simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/stephenmm/vim-mercenary.git

Once help tags have been generated, you can view the manual with
`:help mercenary`.

Heavily inspired by vim-fugitive by Tim Pope: 
https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive

This started out as a fork of fugitive, but I eventually discovered that the 
differences between git and mercurial while minor in functionality are vast in 
implementation. So I started from scratch, using fugitive's code as a reference 
but re-implementing everything to be less of a monkey patch for mercurial.
